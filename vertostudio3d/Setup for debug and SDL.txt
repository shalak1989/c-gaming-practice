See this projects c_cpp_properties and tasks.json files.

TLDR:

1) Download SDL2 and put the include files in MinGW/include
2) lib files in MinGW/lib
3) Put SDL2.dll in the directory where your executable will be created.


At least on windows, it looks like you need to put
#define SDL_MAIN_HANDLED

at the top of any file including SDL.h
