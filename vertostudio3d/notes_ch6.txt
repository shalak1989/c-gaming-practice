arrays are passed by reference into functions (by default)

structs are copied by default into function (passed by value), if you want to mutate
the struct you need to pass by reference with & (ampersand) operator.

the function that takes a reference (address) takes a pointer as one of its parameters.

so func foo(Man *man)

func(&manVariable)

If you want to prevent changes make it a const pointer parameter: func foo(const Man *man)
