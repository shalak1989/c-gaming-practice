gcc .\testgame.c -I C:/development/sdl2/include -L C:/development/sdl2/lib -lmingw32 -lsdl2main -lsdl2 -mwindows

1) -I is the include path you need, we are going to use sdl2 because I don't think the default windows path one worked
2) -L this is the location of the library files and every -l(file) after that are the individual files needed
3) -mwindows tells the compiler to use windows mode, without this you run into errors with things like main etc.

Some of your earlier notes in setup for debug may not be 100% correct.

4) looks like you can just do gcc .\testgame.c -lmingw32 -lsdl2main -lsdl2 -mwindows
-- it looks like the compiler is finding SDL2 in the include path C:/mingw that you put in your environment variables

5) you should probably eventually use a Makefile

6) You need to link -lSDL2_image as well when compiling
